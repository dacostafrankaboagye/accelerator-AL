### Unleashing the Power of Java 17+
-  Scope: Design a system for managing product information in an online store.
    - Exercise 1.1: Modeling Products with Records
        - Create a Record named Product(String name, double price, String category)
        - Explore using accessors (getName(), getPrice(), etc.) to access product data within the Record.
    - Exercise 1.2: Sealing the Product Hierarchy
        - Design a Sealed Class hierarchy for Product with subclasses for different product types (e.g., ElectronicsProduct, ClothingProduct).
        - Utilize sealed subclasses to restrict the creation of unauthorized product types.
    - Exercise 1.3: Exploring New Java Features 
        - Experiment with switch expressions for product category handling.
        - Investigate text blocks for cleaner multi-line string literals within product descriptions (if applicable).
