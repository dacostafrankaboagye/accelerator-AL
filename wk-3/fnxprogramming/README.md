# ðŸ›’ E-commerce Order Processing â€“ Functional Java Practice
This project explores Java functional programming in the context of an e-commerce order system. It uses real-world examples to demonstrate modern Java features such as lambdas, streams, and functional refactoring for cleaner, more maintainable code.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise 3.1: Lambda Power
Refactor imperative code by replacing anonymous inner classes with lambda expressions. This reduces verbosity and improves readability. Also showcases filtering and transforming OrderItems (e.g., by price or category) using lambdas.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise 3.2: Streamlining with Streams
Harness the Streams API (filter, map, reduce, etc.) to process collections of orders. Perform common operations like:
- Calculating total revenue
- Counting orders per customer
- Extracting filtered item lists

ðŸ“Œ Exercise 3.3: Functional Refactoring
Identify repetitive or verbose logic in existing code and refactor it using streams and lambdas. Emphasizes clean and expressive functional style. Example: computing total cost of all "Books" items across orders using chained stream operations.


## Concepts
- Domain Classes (for all)
    - `OrderItem `, `Order `
