## Portfolio Application
This repository hosts a foundational Spring Boot web application for an "Dev Portfolio." The primary focus of this project extends beyond the application's functionality to its robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This pipeline leverages Docker for consistent application containerization and Jenkins for comprehensive automation of the software delivery process.
