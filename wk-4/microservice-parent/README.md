# Java Maven Microservice Project
This is a simple multi-module Maven project built to explore 
key aspects of microservice structuring and Mavenâ€™s advanced capabilities.

â”œâ”€â”€ microservice-core   â†’ Core business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ microservice-data   â†’ Data access logic
â”œâ”€â”€ microservice-app    â†’ Entry point and testable logic
```

### ðŸ”§ Exercise 1.1 â€“ Setting Up Maven Build
- Goal: Learn how to organize a multi-module Maven-based microservice.
âœ… Used a parent pom.xml to manage shared configuration.
âœ… Defined modules:
  - core: Basic logic and utilities. 
  - data: Repository layer with fake/mock order data. 
  - app: Contains the Main class and unit tests.
âœ… Dependency flow:
    - microservice-app depends on core and data.

### ðŸ§ª Exercise 1.2 â€“ Advanced Maven Features
- Goal: Use advanced Maven features like plugins for testing, code coverage, and quality assurance.
âœ… JaCoCo Plugin 
  - Added JaCoCo in microservice-app to generate code coverage reports.
```java
mvn clean verify

:: do this at the microservice parent dir
```
- Generated HTML coverage report:
```java
microservice-app/target/site/jacoco/index.html
```
