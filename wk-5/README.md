# Cloud, Big Data, Security, and Machine Learning

1. Conquering the Cloud with Java  (AWS)
    - A. Cloud Fundamentals (AWS or Azure):
        - Research the core concepts of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and their benefits for Java applications (scalability, elasticity, cost-effectiveness).
        - Identify the specific cloud services offered by your chosen platform (AWS or Azure) that would be most beneficial for your social media application (e.g., scalable compute instances, database services for user data).
    - B. Deploying your Social Media App to the Cloud:
        - Set up a free tier account on your chosen cloud platform (AWS or Azure).
        - Develop a simple Java web application simulating core functionalities of your social media app (e.g., user registration, post creation).
        - Following the platform's specific instructions, deploy your Java application to the cloud.
        Test and monitor the performance of your cloud-deployed application.
